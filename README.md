Pytorch implementation of the activity proposal and detection model
described in our ICONIP 2019 oral paper "Deep Point-wise Prediction for Action Temporal Proposal".


We present a simple and effective method for temporal action proposal generation, 
named Deep Point-wise Prediction (DPP). 
DPP simultaneously predicts the action existing possibility and the corresponding temporal locations, 
without the utilization of any handcrafted sliding window or grouping. 
The whole system is end-to-end trained with joint loss of temporal action proposal classification and 
location prediction.
